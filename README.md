## Hi there!

I'm a mathematician with a passion for technology. I like playing chess, competitive programming, and building things for the web. I'm interested in JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS, Node, TypeScript, and Python.

I'm probably writing about something on [my website](https://tannerdolby.com). Have a look!
