## Hi there!

I'm a mathematician with a passion for technology. I like playing chess, skateboarding, and building things for the web. I'm interested in Java, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node and Python.

I'm probably writing about something on [my website](https://tannerdolby.com). Have a look!
