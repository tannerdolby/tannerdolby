## hey there!

I'm Tanner. A mathematician with an interest in technology. I like playing chess, skateboarding, and building things for the web. I'm interested in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, TypeScript, Python, and Java.

I'm probably writing about something on [my website](https://tannerdolby.com). Have a look!
