## Hi there! 👋

I'm a mathematician with an interest in technology. I like solving problems, playing chess, and building things for the web. I'm interested in JavaScript, Node.js, React, HTML, CSS, and Java.

I'm probably writing about something on [my website](https://tannerdolby.com). Have a look!
