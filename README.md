## Hi there!

I'm a mathematician with a passion for technology. I like to write code and build things for the web. I'm interested in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, React, TypeScript, Python, and C++.

I'm probably writing about something on [my website](https://tannerdolby.com). Have a look!

### Around the web
- [CodePen][codepen] - where I do CSS illustrations, animate things with GSAP, and tinker with web technologies.
- [StackOverflow][stackoverflow]
