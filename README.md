## Hi there!

I like to write code and build things. I'm interested in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, 11ty, Node, React, Python, Java, and C++.

I'm probably writing about something on [my website](https://tannerdolby.com). Have a look!

### Around the web
- [CodePen][codepen] - where I do CSS illustrations, animate things with GSAP, and tinker with web technologies.
- [StackOverflow][stackoverflow] - a rad spot to hangout and learn stuff. I usaully answer web related questions but stay tuned.
