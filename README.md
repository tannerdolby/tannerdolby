Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mathematician with an interest in technology. I like solving problems, playing chess, and building things for the web. I'm interested in JavaScript, Node, TypeScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Java, and Python.

I'm probably writing about something on [my website](https://tannerdolby.com). Have a look!
